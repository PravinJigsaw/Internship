#DAY 24 ARTICLE
##SESSION AND FLUTTER PROGRAMMING
Today i started my day by working the application user interface in flutter.I learnt a few things i that today,like how to insert a  image .
There are two types of inserting the  image in flutter.Network image,asset image.
In network imaging the link of the image is directly add in the syntax of the program.And then it is runned.
In asset image,the image is downloaded and kept in a file,we add the target file in the syntax.And then run the program.
Thats it with the flutter programming.
After that we were called for the session,we were recalled about the topics of the last week,like variables,objects,array,datatype.
We were given a excersie to get clear in those topics above,like they jumbled the syntax and we have to form the correct syntax.
From this i got cleared about those topics.After that we were given a program and told to find the output of that.
After that we were give many types of program and told to find the output of that.Its a start program,we concluded with many outputs.
From that i learnt two news things,they are the string pattern and the next line command.I didnt know \n can be used in dart.
By doing so i learnt the flow of the program.What actually happens when we type codes,and how it is executed internally.
Aftet that we started with the topic called the class.A class is nothing but a blueprint,it is used to plan the program.
The class contains two types in it,they are the properties and the function of a class.The class is used to as two things"it is used as blueprint""it is used for the security",to safeguard the data or information in it.
When we open a class a constructor is created .I learnt that when name=name;It is the terminalogy and it is called the shadowing problem.
To eliminate that,they brought a keyword called "this" in it.I learnt what is execution stack,a stack is nothing but piling something one on top of the other.
The same in execution stacking,the execution part alone keeps stacking till the end of the part of the execution.
The main function is a primary one where in any programming language ,first the main part is executed.After that it goes to the children and so on.
The main function has children example,add function is a children of main.If add has another fucntion like sub or mul,then it is called the child of the add.The main is the parent class of all.
When their is function called add inside the main,when it is called for the add function,then it goes the add part and executes whats inside that,
Once everything inside the add part is executed,then it comes out  of that block,called the block of the add.
Aftet that i learnt what is frameworks,language and database.Framesworks is nothing but a tool for us to build a app or a web page etc.
A language is nothing but a language used to create the code.The database is nothing but the data we store to access.
Their is front end and backend the different between them is nothing,but they use different frameworks and languages.Literally nothing other than that.
In frontend we used to create the user interface for the app or a webpage etc.In user interface their are 4 or 5 interactive they are "touch,command line,buttons,click ".
I learnt what is called api.It is nothing but the application progamming interface.It is used almost used in many codes but for example,api is used in weather forcaste application.When we request for that api ,it responce it with the result.
Thats is for today .
