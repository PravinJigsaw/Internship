##FLUTTER:APP UI DEVELOPING
Today i started my developing the user interface in flutter for the app i designed in figma.In that i learnt the syntax of the rows,columns,adding colors etc.
I was given a assignment to write the code for the user interface used in the flipkart app.After that i learnt that we should change the prespective of the way we look the app uis.
I learnt that even a single dot matters al lot in the user interface creation.I wrote the syntax for the flipkart app and i understood that,how user interface actually works.
After that i was given a assignment to create the login and sign up for my application in flutter.So i started to do that .
I had many doubts and made many mistake in creating the user interface.After that i got cleared how the rows and columns work.
In flutter all the thing we see in eye are widgets,everything is created as a widget and its good.I learnt that.
I learnt the syntax for the colors,border,to use different type of fonts,change the size of the fonts,etc.I learnt that we cannot use the gradient in the scaffold because sacffold has a predefined properties,only those work in the scaffold.
After that i learnt how to add the color gradient in the flutter,i learnt the syntax of that ie",gradient:LinearGradient()".We have to this inside the decoration:BoxDecoration.
I learnt how to use the padding in a container.
After that we were called for the session.In session we were recalled about the datatypes,arrays and keywords.
We were taught about the datatypes in other programming language.i learnt how to use the int dataype in a program and the syntax of the integer datatypes and so on.
I learnt that there is a language called typescript and its syntax is quite different like "add():number".Here add is function name,arguments are given inside the brackets,number is the return type.
I learnt that a fumction has two phases they are "1.Declaration,2.Execution ".If you did not call a function but you wrote even a 100 functions,itnot worth it.Its just a dead body.I learnt that the functions are capable of  returning the output.
I learnt that how the objects datatype,to represent a object, the arguments are passed in the {}.The value should be like the a key :value.
I learnt about the string properties,if anything is given between the ""then it is taken as a string.If two function is added it also gives a string value.It does not a give a int or a float or anything.
When a two strings are added it is called as string concantination.
We were given a examples of the topics above and i understood them.
Thats it for today.
