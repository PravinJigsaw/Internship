#DAY 7 ARTICLE
##FIGMA,BOOK READING
Today i started my day by reading the book Barking at the wrong tree.As i mentioned earlier i learnt that there are two kinds of students.
They are called as dangelions and buds,means the good and bad.Their is a scientific study on these kinds.It is caused by the genes.
They have proven that,kids with this bad gene growing up with bad parenting causes more threat to the society.
At the same time kids with this gene and have a good parenting and guidence shine the brightest of all.
Kids who have good genes,grow with bad parenting are depressed,become lonley and end their life at any situation.
So i learnt that,it mostly depends on the path they are meant to go and parenting and guidence.
Kids with these bad genes are good in the correct environment and the odd one can be beautiful.
I learnt that everything created in this world are for a reason ,thats true once again.But not everyone are in the right place to shine more.
This is a good example for that,if a parents gave birth to a child,but the child is abnormal,like it has long hands,short lower body and long upper body.
True the parents cant be completely happy cause of the baby being born weird.But if a well known swimming coach see a baby like this kind of abnormalities.
The only thing goes in his mind is the olympic medal.Once again its is true that all the people are not in the right place to shine like a star..
After that i started learning figma,today i learnd new features of figma like fading out colors,connecting differnt prototypes.
I started seeing videos about figma,in that i learned how they really design a application and got some ideas for designing the ui.
I tryed to make some changes to the picture we add.I learnt how to add the radial,angular,linear,solids etc color radiants to make it look beautifull
I learnt how to flaten the curves and make the containers look smooth.I learnt how to get the icons from google for different operations.
In todays evening session once again we recalled the git commands and we were told to push a sample file with markdown language
Today morning while i was practising the git commands i had lots of mistake and i learnt to clear the each mistake ive made,like creating the repostory in the correct place,use the git init command in the exact directory we need to push etc.I cleared some dougths for m fellow interns as well,by that i practiced more and learnt differnt type of errors we made and we cleared it.
Thats it for today.
