#DAY 22 ARTICLE
##APPLICATION UI IN FLUTTER
Today i started my day by creating the application user interface for the app i created the design.
First i learnt how to create the row and the column correctly, i learnt the properties of the scaffold.After that i learnt how to give the background color.
The syntax of the background color is "backgroundColor:Colors.red ".We can give whatevre color we want,and we can also use the RGB for assigning the colors.
I learnt that a container can have a child,that child can be a text or a column or even a row.Row and column can have children,child,text or even a column or row.
Ive to use the color gradient in my login page.We cannot use the color gradient inside the scaffold because it does not have a property like that.
So what i did was i wrapped the scaffold as a container to use the color gradient in it.I learnt that.
The scaffold have properties like title,appbar and so on .
After that i learnt how to use the shadow in the icons or containers.The syntax of that is"BoxDecoration:[BoxShadow()]"
I learnt how to use the different font style in the flutter.We can use them by the keyword fontFamily after that we have to enter the font we want.
When we hava a space but we dont wanna use that,then we have to use the class called sized box.It is used to create a invisible container.
The syntax of that is "const SIzed Box(widht,height)".It also works like the padding.They are somewhat same .
After that i learnt to add icons and text to it.It is "Icons.the icon name "
I learnt that how the margin padding works.A margin is nothing but the space outside the container as the name say margin.A padding is the space inside the container.And a sizedbox is nothing but a invisible container.
After that we were called for the session.We were recalled the topics took this week.I got cleared in those topics.
I learnt that translator is also one type of a compiler.What is a compiler?It is nothing but the combination of lexical analysis,syntatical analysis,sematic analysis.
When we search for something in the internet ,our search query is validated by these steps.If any of these steps fail then it is called as the compile time error.
Once again i learnt that the algorithms are the root of a code or anything.So it very important.
The first three are called the compiler.After the compiler there is a another step called the code generation.Where the code is converted into the machine level language.Which is 01.Because the computers can understand only 01.What ever we code finally it is made to 01 .
I learnt what is assembly level language.It is nothing but the combination of the both 01 and the arithmetics like the add,sub,mul.div,move etc.
In the early stage only computers printed the 01 after that the assembly level language for created.After that the compilers where created.
We type the code in english,we use the compilers to change the language from human level to the machine level.
Thats it for today.
