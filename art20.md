##BOOKREADING AND FLUTTER BASICS
Today i started my day reading the book named Barking to the wrong tree.In that i learnt a lot of things.I learnt the almost like a rule in games.
They are "WINNABLE,NOVEL CHALLENGES,GOALS,FEEDBACK".I learnt that why job isnt a fun one.The answer is quite simple,really work as we know it today is a really louzy game.
I leanrt that  you werent born to do anything in particular but when your story says you were born to do something you perform better and persist.After all its our "destiny".
I also learnt that fate is that thing we cannot avoid.It comes for us despite how we try to run from it.Destiny,on the other hsnd id the thing we must chase,what we must bring to fruition.
So how do u find your story?Its simple just think about your death once,it will make us what we want.
After that i started learning the dart in flutter ,like the basic syntax like row and column.
I learnt how to create a container using dart in flutter its syntax is"container( //body of the container)".I learnt that we can do in inide a body.
After that i learnt what all can be created in a row.In a row we can create a column,can create text,a container,etc.
I learnt the syntax for margin and padding that is "margin:EdgeInsets.all(),padding:EdgeInsets.all()".
I learnt how to give colors to the container and how to give colors to the text.How to change the font size of the text etc.
I was making mistakes in the brackets and after that i practised and got clear in that a little bit.I understood how its works.It differs from dart programming language for somethings like after every curl bracket we should use comma','.
I learnt what is mainaxisalignment and crossaxisalignment.Mainaxisalignment is used to align the text or container horizontally.
A crossaxisalignment is used to align the text or container vertically.The syntax for mainaxis alignment is "mainAxisAlignment:MainAxisAlignment.evenly spaced".Same follow for crossaxisalignment we use the name instead.
After that we went to the session,we were told to present the language assignment we were given.
I learnt how a search engine works when we ask it for something in any language.It has three analysis phase"Lexical analysis,Syntatical analysis and Sematical analysis".Finally in enters to the code which is code generator.
It analize our input and checks its for the correct formation and then sends it to the next step which is syntatical analysis.
It checks the sentence formation of the given input if it have some meaning to it ,it is send to the third one which is sematical analysis.It checks the meaning the given input and finally send to the code genertor.
It genrate the code and fetch us what we are requested.
After that i learnt that english have noun,verb etc.Same as a programming language.Its just a other language we have to look it in that perspective.
So the thing is we have to understand its symbols, tokens,expressions,rules etc to communicate with the computer.
As i said in english we have noun etc same in programmoing language but in a diferent word they are "int,bool,string" etc.
Thats it for today ,i hope ill learn more tomorrow.
