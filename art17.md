#DAY 17 ARTICLE
##BOOK READING AND DART PROGRAMMING
Today i started my day by reading the book named Barking to the wrong tree.In that i learnt a lot of things which are inspirational,i learnt that our brains can makes mistakes too,our brain usually trickd us alot.They try to bring the logic but even they can be fooled or tricked.
This was proved by the optical illusion, we all know the optical illussion of the two sticks of same size.BUt when u make in linear theyll appear to be differernt.
Those scientist wanna prove to people to not only hear but experiernce the fact that we cant trust the brain always.
I learnt that how to predict a childs emotional well being.It does not depend on the great schools or hugs or pixar movies.Researches found that wheter the kid knew their family history is the number one indicator.
I learnt that when we relate to characters in fictional stories we are more likely to overcome obstacles to achieve our goals.
Optimists told themeselves a story that may not have been true,but it kept them going,often allowing them to beat the odds.
I learnt that law is the highest paid jobs in us.But they were not the happy but deppressed.If we know the truth we cant be happy.
I learnt that meaningfull doesnt have to be saving orphans or curing the sick.As long as your story has  meaning in it it has power.
After that i started learning the dart programming i practised the loops tryed to understand how does that work and learnt the logic of the loops.I tryed 2,3 problems myself.
I learnt about the if loops , data type about their definitions syntax etc.
Thats it for today,i hope ill learn more tomorrow.
