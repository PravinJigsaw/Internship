#DAY 13 ARTICLE
## BOOK READING AND DART PROGRAMMING.
Today i started my day by reading the book named Barking to the wrong tree.Yesterday i was wrong anout the maldovans.They lacked everything because they were not trusting anyone other than themselves.
After that i learnt that their are three types of people,they are the matchers,giver,takers.Matchers are like team leaders,givers are like helping others to make themselve happy and takers are the people who are selfish and take everything from ohters.
The matchers are like the leaders they balance the givers and the takers.The givers always help others and give everything what they have.
Oftern the takers are in the middle because they take everything from the givers,they are selfish.They givers are always exploited by the takers.
At the top and bottom we can find only the givers,many of the givers are exploited but at the long term the givers will go to the top.
Matchers are their to protect the givers, they punish the takers if they start a figth with the givers,and make them pay to  for that.
For a team givers and matchers are so important and so takers too in my opinion.
Johnson Don made 6$ millionin one night in gambling.He was a inspiration for me cause their is a saying in the casino that"AT THE END THE HOUSE WINS"
But for the others he was the house cause he almost outplayed everyone who played gambling.He was not cheating or doing any illegal stuff,h won only by his hard work and his intelligence in mathematics.This shows that good people win sometimes.It was purely because of his intelligence
After that we had the session,in todays session we were  recalled about the assignment problem which is the t rex problem.I  cleared my doubts after that.
Today after that we were given another problem which is the brigde problem,in that we have to cross every brigde by touching it only one time.
The funny thing was their is no solution for that problem.So i learnt that if someone gives us a problem first we have to check if their is a solution for that problem.
There were odd numbers of bridged so it has  no solution for thatmy doubts after that.After that we were given another problem which is the dot problem.
In that first i did was i checked how many dots were there,20 dots were there.So thing problem have a solution and i solved it under a miniute.
After that i started learning the dart programming language,i was recalling the functions which i leanrt yesterday and cleared all of my doubts.
I learnt an new functions like fibonacci series and lambda function today and completed the all the types of the function.
In lambda function we can bring the output of any simple programms like addition subraction or even find the fiboncci series in one line.
Its syntax is "return_type function_name(arguments) => arguments + arguments" we can make any simple programms in one line using the lambda function.It was easy for me to that.
Thats it for today and i learnt some basic html tags like style,position,href etc and did that theoritically.
Thats it for today.
