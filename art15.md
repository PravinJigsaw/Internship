#DAY 15 ARTICLE
#BOOK READING AND DART PROGRAMMING
Today i started my day by reading the book named Barking to the wrong tree.In that i learnt lot of things,their are sis rule to be followed always.
"pick the right pond,cooperate first,being selfless isnt saintly,its silly,work hard but make sure it gets noticed,think long term and make othersthink long term,forgive".
After that i started the 3rd chapter called do quitter never win and winners never quit?.These things started all with reading the comic book.
I learnt that i doesnt matter if we dont speak english or we are poor theonly matters is out hard work and persistence.
A boy called alfred achieved everything in his life by hard work and persistence only in his life.He became a doctor by his hardwork only,he was a very poor boy and a he had to work for his family.
 I learnt that we can achieve success at anytime,this is the best example for that.When alfred got his doctor degree he was married and had a 6 month old baby in his hand.Many say we cant achieve anything if we are married.In this case it is false.
Today alfred is known as doctor q and hes the in the  top 10 best brain surgeon.
The grit is also the main reason for success,our culture beats us over head with the idea that grit sticking to something,working hard and not quitting is the screte too success.
I learnt that grit is one of the key reasons why we see such different levels of achievments between the people of same intelligence.
After that i started learning the dart programming,i was learning the the lists in the dart.Its is nothing but an array in the form of objects.
A list is a simply an ordered group of objects.There are two type of lists they are"Fixed lenght list,Growbable lists".
There are different type also like one dimension list,two dimensional list and three dimensional lists.
After that in todays seccion we recalled the previous sessions topic like computational complex problems.After that we learnt that computers are dumb.
We actually give innstruction to the computers they perform the action.
After that we learnt that what is"Ideal algorithm".If a algorithm satisfies all the condition in any system then it is called the best algorithm.
We learnt that execution always depend on the planning.The key for good program is figuring out the algorithm.
After that we were given a task to write the algorithm for making the robot do some tasks.It was a fun task but learnt a lot about what is algorithm how it should be written like that.
Actually we acted like robot that taught me alot how a robot responds to such things like walk forward,sit stand sort of stuff.
Thats it for today.
