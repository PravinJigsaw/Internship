I made a mistake in the prototyping of connecting the link,so i learnt how to make it right and connected everything correctly.
In figma we can make the vertical and horizontal scrolling,i read the documents to make the vertical and horizontal scrolling.
First we have to make a selection of the group we wanna add scroll to it,for that we have to select the items and rigth click to make the group.
After we make the group we have to right click and click the frames option to make the frame for the selected items.
After that we have to go to the design on th right side of the page to click the clip it to the screen,by doing so we can clip the things which are going outside of the screen to make it look it neater.
After we finishe these steps we have to go the prototye and select the vertical or horizontal scrolling.
We have to check the it buy click the present button the right top corner,to view in the mobile phone.
To use the radial and linear color mode we have to select the color and set the color area to apply it,we can merge the colors buy doing so.
After that started reading the book named Barking of the wrong tree,i learnt that in some cases the greatest tragedies  produce the greatest inernsifires.
Abraham lincoln,Gandhi,Michelangelo,Mark Tiwan the common things in them is they all lost their their parents  when they were 16.
The thing i learnt in this is people likly to be orphan like this are spectaculary successfull in the life.
When we talk about leadership filtration theory,their is a obvious question "how will i become successful in life".I learnt that there are 2 ways for that .
First one is to know thyself.It means if we bring fourth ourself out,it will save us,if we dont bring fourth ourselfs out,the same thing will destroy us.
Second one is "pick the right pond".
Once you know what type of person you are and find your signature and strengths,it will lead us to the second piece of advice from "Mukundas".
Thats it for the reading.
After that they gave us about a awareness of cyber security.
In the cyber security awareness they taught us about how to search safely,and how not to use the browser,and how to give permissions to the apps.
I learnt that we should always turn off the tracking in our browser.
I learnt that we shouldnt click the random things in a browser like ads pop ups etc,if we do so we may be attacked by a malacious scripts or virus
We shoudnt take a random thumb drive or pendrive from anywhere and insert in our laptop,cause it may have some virus,that may affect our system.
Mostly use brave browser cause it is more trusted than any other browser,cause it has lot of protection etc.
I learnt that we shouldnt connect to any random free wifi which we get in public place,cause some may try to enter in between.
And one more thing i learnt is we should use any website which is in the http format cause it is not encrypted.We should prefer only websites which is in https format so it is encrypted,so it is safe for us.
That is for today.
