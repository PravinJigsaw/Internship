# BOOK READING AND DART PROGRAMMING
Today i started my day by reading the book named Barking to the wrong tree.I learnt that in everything we do,we must have trust on each other,even if we are robbing a bank and we caught.
Even if the police interogates us separtely for robbing the bank my partner and i should be trusting each other even if they scare the hell out of us.
When the cold war raging between the ussr and united states,Robert axelrod started a tournament of computer programmes with different strategies played prisoners dilemma to see which one racked up the most points.
In this tournament a programm called TFT won.How?Simple the stratedy of the tft program was a simple TIT for TAT technique.If this program is attacked by a another programm he used  the same thing what he was attacked.This made him win in everyround.
The thing i learnt was alwasys be simple and watch everymove of the opponent.This strategy made him win everytime.
But at one time Tft was lacking something in his programms that is forgiveness,he even added this to his program and made it perfect.
I learnt that we shoundnt be always punishing others for their mistake but we have to forgive them too.This made TFT one step ahead.We should alwasys balance our emotions and always keep watching the opponents.
The four rules of the TFT was to "DONT BE ENVIOUS","DONT BE THE FIRST TO DEFECT","RECIPROCATE BOTH COOPERATION AND DEFECTION"and"DONT BE TOO CLEVER".
I learnt these four rules for winning.After that i started learning the dart programming language.
I recalled everything i learnt before like the types of functions in dart etc.I started learning the variables in the dart language.
I learnt that a variable is a name assign to the memory location and used to store a value and called during its need throughtout the code.
Syntax of variable is "type_variable_name;".I learnt that their are 4 conditions for variable like,variable name cannot be a keyword,variavble can have numbers and alphabets,variables cant start with numbersand only 2 special cases can be use $ and _.
I learnt that interger,double,boolean,string,lists,maps are the types of variabls.
I learnt what is dynamic variable,it is nothing but we can reassign a value to the variable which is already assigned.Syntax is "dynamic variable_name;"
After that i learnt what is final and const keyword.It is nothing but,if we assign a value to a variable using this keyword,the value of the variable cant be reassigned through out the code.Syntax"final/const variable_name;".
I learnt what is boolean variable.In dart boolean datatype supports only two conditions they are true and false.Syntax of the boolean datatype is "bool var_name = true;,bool var _name = false;".
After that i learnt that what is double datatype in dart.The double is a datatype that stores only the values that are in decimal.For each double variable,eight bytes are allocated in the memory.
After that i learnt what are keywords in dart.They are set of reserved words which cant be used as vaiables or identifers.
Keywords such as "const,final,int,string,throw,catch,rethrow,if,for"etc.
Thats it for today i hope ill learn more tommorrow.
