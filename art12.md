##FIGMA AND DART
Today i started my day by completing the figma project and recalled everything and made some changes.After that i started reading the book named,the barking to the wrong tree.
In that i learnt today same again trust.The trust is the ultimate thing in everything we do. I was impressed by the maldovan again cause they dont care about anything their life but they were successful.
I read only few today and thats it.After thati started learning the basics of the dart language like the functions,addition,subraction,fibeonaci seies,optional parameters.
In function learnt the syntax,first we have to declare a function and then we have to give some operation and then print in the main and get the result.
In addition,i used the add keyword and added the parameters from the function.Same in subraction.
I learnt what is fibinocci series,it is the additon of the upcoming preceding numbers that is 0,1,2,3,5,8,13 and so on.I used the concept and worked in it.
I learnt what is optional parameters,their are three parameters that is optional position parameters,optional naming parameter,and optional default parameters.
In position parameters,it is nothing but we can pass a argument which we use or may not use in the further program [].
in naming parameters,it is nothing but,used to name or pass the value of the parameter to another function.It is denoted by {}.
The default parameters have a default value in it but if we use that parameter,we have to call it in the program or it will show us error.
I was not sure about what is positon parameter so i asked kukesh to explain me he cleared  my doubt and gave me a inforamation about NULL.
I learnt that dart updated their compiler to clear the NULL error in the program.It was done recently before 6 month.So i learnt that from him.
Today in evening session we were recalled about the prepostion,conjunction and the disjunction.So i was cleared about thSo i learnt that from him.
Today in evening session we were recalled about the prepostion,conjunction and the disjunction.So i was cleared about that.
After that we were given a assignment about the prepostions to find whether the statement is prepostion or conjunction or disjunction.
After that we were taught us about what is IDEAL TEAM PLAYER.
There is three rules to be followed that is to be humble,hungry and smart that is people person.
It is important to be the all the three person.If we are only humble  it is called pawns.If we are only hungry we are called bulldozers.If we are only smart we are called charmer.
If we are humble and hungry then we are called as accidental mess makers.If we are humble and smart then we are called as lovable slackes,they last very long.
If we are hungry and smart then we are called as skillfull politions but they are the major destructiion.
We have to be the person like does the work,listens and takes the feddback wether its bad or good,who supports the other team members and shares without holding back.
The important thing is always we have to be the same person who is humble,hungry and smart.It helps us and other to grow well.
Thats it for today.
