#DAY 18 ARTICLE
BOOK READING AND DART PROGRAMMING
Today i started my day by reading the book named Barking to the wrong dog.Today i learnt the mentallity of the humans.They tested by testing the it on the dog.
They had a shock which is given after the a waring sound.eveytime they did this the dogs were shocked.So they started testing with the humans,they did the same like the dogs.
And i learnt that we should be optimistic person all the time but some times,being a pessimists helps us.
What is shocking is that when u ask the depressed person to make predictions,they are more accurate than the optimistic people.Its called depressive realism.
Its because optimists alwasys lie to their mind like it will be over soon or it is nothing or it is part of the life.
Optimists and pessimists shape their story of the world very differnetly.Seligman called explanatory style and it comes down to three p."Permanence,Pervasiveness and personlization".
I learnt that when you shift your explanatory style from pessimistic to optimistic it makes you feel you better and it makes you grittier.
I learnt that we have two choices when we wake up,1.we can go back to bed and dream what we wanna become or 2.we can get up start chasing what we dreamed.
Its not easy to be successful in life,frankly what is to give light must endure burning and we dont give up.Its the story we tell to us and keep us going.
I learnt that we have to consider our life as a game.We know game is lot more tougher than our lifes,we have to kill stuffs,run from it etc.But we dont give up on that game.Same like that we have to think about our lifes.
This is true because their is man named joe who did the same when he was about to die,hes a mountain climber.while climbing a mountain he slipped and got injured badly.
He cant climb anymore and he was bleeding so badly,so he decided to go back to the camp which is 20 mins away from him.He thougth reaching his camp is game and won in that game and he was save.After that i started learning the dart prgramming.
I learnt what is the "temp" keyword in dart,it is nothing but a file or a directory provided by the operating system.
I learnt what is map in dart programming, a map is a simple key or value pair.Map is a dynamic collection.
There are two types of map " map literals and map constructor".I practiced simple example problems in map.
After that we were taken a small session of what is responsibility,duty,free will and obligation.I learnt what is obligation in that cause i dont about it.
I learn what is the culture in the surfboard.It is not actually surfboard culture instead it is the culture of our own.
After that i learnt how a algorithm exactly should be means the proper way.
We were taught about what is a language,when we can understand a language.We were given a assignment of creating our own language like the rules for it symbols and arithmetic things like +- etc.
Thats it for today .I hope ill learn more tomorrow.
