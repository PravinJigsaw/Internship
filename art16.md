i#DAY 16 ARTICLE 
##BOOK READING AND DART PROGRAMMING
Today i started my day by reading the book named Barking to the wrong tree.In that i learnt a lot today too.As i said before grit is one of the important key to the success.
I learnt that creative people frame their experiences,such people are highly ambitious and they do not always succeed.
But when they fail they never give up or they do not waste much time in lammenting or blaming.Instead regarding the failure as a learning experience,they try to build upon its lesson.
The main thing is "Be gritty and we ll be successful".I learnt a lot from the story of a swimmer.
A boy names James,he wanna join the ALL amaerican,but he is a swimmer and he felt he stuck in that.One day in a swimming competition he broke his hand.After that his training in the swimming fell down.
He never gave up 6 years later he was found swimming but in a different place.That place is called the BUD/S.It is a navy training camp.
From this story i learnt one thing that is we should talk to ourselves positivly.Actually a scientific study shown that talking to ourselves push ourselves to the extreme makes a good result than others.
James used to talk with him often.Out of 257 candidates only 16 were selected and in that 16 James was one.I liked this story very much.It was a inspiration for me.
The things that i learnt is grit sticking,be optimistic,focus in what we do and dont quit.
After that i started learning the dart programming language,I recalled the topics i learnt yesterday,like lists and its types.
Today i started the loops in dart language.They are "for loop,while loop,do while,for in loop".For loop is nothing but a condition is processed tile the condition becomes incomplete.
Its syntax is "for(initial;condition;test eperiment)".While loop is nothing but the is processed till the given condition is true.
Its syntax is "while(condition){test expression;} ".Do while loop is nothing but the reverse of the while loop where the body is checked first adn then it enter to the condition.
I learnt that their are tow keywords important for loops in dart language.That is "continue and break".
After that i started learning the arthmetic operators like +,-,* etc.
After  learnt the comparison operators like ==,===,!= etc.
I learnt how to find the even number in a random set of numbers and how to find the fibonacci numbers using for loop.
After that we went to the session,we were recalled about the previous session topic like introduction to algorithm,After that we were given a algorthim to solve it was a simple one but i made a mistake, i do it many times like i know the answer but to complete it fast i leave the importants points.I learnt i should change that.
Thats its for today.
