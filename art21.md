#DAY 21 ARTICLE
##BOOK READING AND FLUTTER PROGRAMMING
Today i started my day by doing the flutter programming.In that i learnt lots like the rows and column etc.
when we open a column,a row,column,text also can be implemented.When we open a row or a column we have to use children and we have to use the child in it.
I learnt how to use the color gradient in the flutter programming.I learnt the syntax of that.
I learnt that how to use the background color,i had some doubts in that i cleared the doubt.
I learnt how to use the style keyword for styling the text,changing the font size and adding color to it.
In flutter i learnt how to add app bar and text inside a app bar and adding color to it spacing it evenly .
I learnt what is boxshadow,it is used to create a shadow.Its syntax is "Box shadow(color:color.green,spread radius :3)".
I learnt how to draw circle.Its syntax is "Draw circle(c.dx,c.dy,radius,paint._objects,paint._data)";
After in session we were taugth about what is language and how it is framed.
In programming language symbols are taken from the UNICODE which is letters from all the language from the world in that english is chosen and programming languages are built using english.
I learnt what are token.They are nothing but the identifiers,operators,punctuators,num literals,string literals.
The expressions are a combo of tokens.
I learnt the types of keywords like async,throw,catch,const,extend,int,string,boolean etc.
I learnt that what are datatypes in the programming languages such as javascript and dart.It is nothing but the type of data we given.
There are two types of datatypes they are primitive datatypes and composite datatypes.
The primitive datatypes is nothing but the string,int,bool,double,float.The composite datatypes are nothing but the array,objects and functions.
I learnt that array is nothing but the lists .
Objects is nothing but the inputs we give inside the {} are said to be objects.
The function is nothing but add,sub etc these are the exampls of functions.
I learnt the syntax of these like int a = 5;In this the int is the datatype, a is the identifer,= is the assiging operator,5 is the num literal and ; is the sentence terminator.
Programming language is nothing but the collection of these things but in the correct form and correct syntax.So its easy if we look in that perspective.
Thats its for today.
