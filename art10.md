#DAY 10 ARTICLE
#BOOK READING AND FIGMA
Today i started my day by reading the book named barking of the wrong tree.In that i learnt,as mukundas said it is important that we have to ourself.
We have to know ourself,in terms of achieving what we want in life,means being aware of our strengths.It helps pepole to say to an opportunity.
We have to say YES ill do that.but this the way i should be doing it.This is the way it should be structured.This is the way my relationship should be.
This context affects everyone,which companies,institution,and situations value what i do?.I learnt that,the conscientious valedictorians so good at the following rules often stumbles the most here.
If we can answer these questions and if we follow these,we can be successful in life.
Charles platt was the winner 1994 for HUMANS.I learnt that he did not speak english or he was not the filtered one.He did that by moody,irritable,and obnoxious.
I learnt that it was because of the flaws are what makes us most human.Charles patt found success through human flaws.
Do nice guys finish last?.Yes sometimes they finish last.Cause i read a story of a doctor named M swango,he was a serial killer ,and he was a successfull serial killer.Everybody know that he killed a person,a patient saw that and reported to the authority but they didnt take any action because of the hospital name.I learnt that its is sometime true that nice guys finish last.
After that i started doing my application design today i learnthow to crop the images in the figma.It is very easy to ceop the images or svgs.
First we have to import the image to the figma and then we have to select the crop option which is in the rigth side of the page.trim it to crop the images.
After that i started creating the next page for the application.And i finished the pages .
Thats it for today.
