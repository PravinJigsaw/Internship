##BOOK READING DART PRORAMMING AND BASIC OF FLUTTER
Today i started my day by reading the book named Barking to the wrong tree.In that If you are immune to boredom there is literaly nothing you cannot accomplish.
In many ways this is very true.If you never got bored youd be a big step closer to being a computer.
I learnt that we can apply game mechanics to our lives and turn dull moments into fun ones.This can make us gritter at work and lead to success.
I learnt that we are what we pretend to be,so we must be carefull about what we pretendto be.
I also learnt that when school classes and grading are structured like a game,students perform better.
After that i started learning the dart programming,i recalled all the topics i learnt past week.I leanrt the "if statement"and their types like else if loop,if ladder etc.
I learnt the syntax of those.After i tried a simple examples problems i clearded the doubts i had.
After that i learnt the the basics of the flutter in dart.
I learnt the basic like the row and columns,the syntax about the rows and columns.
I learnt how to set the colors of the background,what is padding,sized box.Padding is used as a invisible space between where we wanna give it.
I practised writing that the syntax for those.
Thats it for today, i hope ill learnt more tomorrow.
